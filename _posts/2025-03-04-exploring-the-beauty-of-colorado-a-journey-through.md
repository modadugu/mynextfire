**Exploring Colorado: A Scenic Family Adventure**





Colorado is a land of breathtaking landscapes, rugged mountains, and endless outdoor adventures. Our recent family trip to this magnificent state was nothing short of magical, packed with scenic drives, hiking trails, starry nights, and unforgettable experiences. Here’s a detailed account of our journey through the State, perfect for families looking for an adventure-filled getaway.









**Day 1: Arrival and Rocky Mountain National Park**



We picked up our rental car from **Enterprise Rent-A-Car** at around **11 AM** and set off toward **Rocky Mountain National Park**. Our first stop was **Bear Lake**, a pristine alpine lake surrounded by towering peaks. The easy hike around the lake was a great way to immerse ourselves in nature before heading to **Alberta Falls**, a picturesque waterfall that made for an excellent afternoon adventure for the whole family.





In the evening, we checked into our hotel and wrapped up the day with a relaxing dinner and some quality family time.









**Day 2: More Rocky Mountain Exploration**



The next day, we dove deeper into **Rocky Mountain National Park**, driving along the scenic **Trail Ridge Road**—one of the highest paved roads in North America. Along the way, we hiked the **Cub Lake Trail** and explored **Mountain Trail**, both offering stunning views of wildflowers, meadows, and wildlife. These trails were family-friendly and provided opportunities for kids to explore nature at their own pace.





After another fulfilling day in the great outdoors, we returned to our hotel for a restful night.









**Day 3: Longmont to Grand Junction**



An early start at **7 AM** marked the beginning of our journey toward **Grand Junction**, a **5-hour drive** with stops along the way.





We took a break in **Breckenridge** and **Vail**, where we enjoyed an exhilarating **ziplining and gondola experience**. The mountain views from above were absolutely worth it! After spending about three hours partaking in various summer activities, we continued our journey.





Post-lunch, we made a stop at **Glenwood Hot Springs Pool**, a perfect spot for families to relax and unwind in the warm mineral waters before reaching our hotel for the night.









**Day 4: The Black Canyon of the Gunnison**



We dedicated the day to exploring the **Black Canyon of the Gunnison**. We visited the **South Rim Visitor Center**, took in the views at **Pulpit Rock Overlook** and **Devil’s Lookout**, and hiked the **Cedar Point Nature Trail**. For those looking for a slightly longer adventure, the **Warner Point Trail** offers a **1.5-mile out-and-back hike**, great for older kids and teens.





With some extra time, we considered a short drive through the **San Juan Mountains**, a historic mining area. By **2-3 PM**, we set off toward **Durango**, driving along the **Million Dollar Highway**, one of the most scenic (and thrilling) drives in the U.S.





In the evening, we planned for **stargazing in Durango**, taking advantage of the area’s minimal light pollution—an unforgettable experience for the whole family.









**Day 5: Exploring Mesa Verde National Park**



The day was dedicated to **Mesa Verde National Park**, home to well-preserved Ancestral Puebloan cliff dwellings. We started at the **Mesa Verde Visitor & Research Center**, then explored **Chapin Mesa** and hiked the **Petroglyph Point Trail (2.4-mile loop)**. Driving the **Mesa Top Loop** gave us a glimpse of ancient dwellings and panoramic views. The history and cultural significance of this park were both educational and engaging for the entire family.





By **3-4 PM**, we hit the road again for a **4-hour drive** to **Great Sand Dunes National Park**, arriving in time to check in at our hotel. The evening was spent **stargazing**, a mesmerizing experience in the vast, dark skies of the dunes.









**Day 6: Sand Dunes Adventure and the Road Back**



The morning was all about adventure—**hiking the dunes and sandboarding!** We rented sandboards from the **Oasis Store** and spent about **3-4 hours** gliding down the golden dunes. The experience was thrilling and unique, making it a highlight of the trip for kids and adults alike.





By **2-4 PM**, we began our **4-hour drive** back to **Denver**. On the way, we took a scenic drive through the **Garden of the Gods**, a stunning red rock formation near Colorado Springs.





To cap off the trip, we enjoyed one last meal together, reminiscing about our favorite moments from the journey. Finally, we returned the rental car by **10 PM**, officially concluding our unforgettable family adventure in Colorado.
