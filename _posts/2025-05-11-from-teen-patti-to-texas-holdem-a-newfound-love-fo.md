How a Casual Game Turned into a Friday Night Ritual



It all started with a simple game of **Teen Patti**—a classic Indian home game that brought a few of us together on quiet evenings. At first, it was just about fun, laughter, and the occasional bluff. But somewhere along the way, a spark ignited. That casual game turned into a genuine curiosity for poker.









Friday Nights, Strategy, and Laughter



What began as a few friendly hands evolved into **Friday night poker sessions**—a weekly tradition where we’d not only play but connect, unwind, and share stories over snacks and some drinks.





The more we played, the more we realized that poker is far more than a game of chance. Sure, luck plays its role, but so does reading people, timing, discipline, and evolving your strategy.









Learning Through Each Other



What’s been most fascinating is watching how everyone has started **studying each other’s gameplay**, picking up on patterns, adjusting tactics, and learning from wins and losses alike.





It’s not about being the best at the table—it’s about getting better every time. The game has become a mix of healthy competition, personal growth, and genuine camaraderie.









No Pros, Just Passion



While none of us are professionals, the **rules and rhythms of our game keep evolving**. We’re constantly open to feedback—tweaking formats, trying different variants, and accommodating everyone’s preferences. That openness keeps the energy fresh and inclusive. No egos—just good vibes and better play.





The game itself has grown with us—from a simple cash game with a $10 buy-in to playing with the equivalent of **$10 worth of coins**, and now $10 buy-in to playing with the equivalent of **$40 coins**. As the stakes gently increased, so did the thrill. We’ve added structure by **raising blinds** and even introduced a fun twist: **tipping the dealer** after winning a big pot. It adds a friendly casino-like touch and keeps the atmosphere lighthearted.









A New Beginning to 2025



As we build new interests and find better ways to relax, **poker has become more than a game—it’s a ritual**. A space to slow down, to bond, and to challenge ourselves in new ways.





So here’s to the cards, the chips, the banter, and the bluffs—**this is our new beginning to 2025**, one hand, one laugh, one Friday night at a time.





And as the year unfolds, we’re excited to see how this tradition evolves—new players, new formats, maybe even a mini tournament of our own. Here’s to staying curious, connected, and always a little unpredictable… just like the next card on the river.





***Because at the end of the day, it’s not just about the cards we’re dealt—it’s about how we play them, together.***
