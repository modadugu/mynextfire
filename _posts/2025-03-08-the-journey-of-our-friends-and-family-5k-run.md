It all started in March 2022, with just a small group of five to six families coming together with a shared goal: to stay active, build a sense of community, and contribute to a meaningful cause. What began as a casual gathering soon evolved into something much larger, now proudly comprising 20 families and growing. last month, we celebrated the incredible milestone of hosting 3 years!





The Birth of a Tradition



Our monthly 5K program, now fondly known as the "Friends and Family Run," has become an integral part of our lives. Each month, one family assumes the responsibility of hosting the event, ensuring that everything runs smoothly and that the experience remains enjoyable for everyone involved. The premise is simple yet powerful: each participant must complete a 5K, whether by running, walking, or cycling, depending on their age and ability.





Giving Back to the Community



A unique and rewarding aspect of our initiative is the charity component. Each participant contributes a small amount to the host fund, and the host family donates the collected amount to a charity of their choice. This not only fosters a sense of generosity but also allows us to give back to our communities in meaningful ways. Over time, we have been able to support numerous causes, making a tangible difference in the lives of those in need.





Building Bonds Over Breakfast



Beyond the run itself, the event is about spending quality time together. The host family arranges breakfast for all the participants, creating a space where everyone can relax, share stories, and enjoy each other's company. It has become a tradition for the kids to gather, play, and socialize, strengthening friendships and fostering a spirit of togetherness.





Looking Ahead



As we reflect on this journey, we are filled with gratitude and excitement for what the future holds. What started as a simple idea among a few families has blossomed into a cherished tradition that brings people together, promotes health and wellness, and supports charitable causes. We look forward to continuing this journey and inspiring even more families to join us.





A Heartfelt Thank You



None of this would have been possible without the enthusiasm, commitment, and generosity of every family who has participated over the years. A heartfelt thank you to each and every one of you who helped turn a small vision into a self-sustainable event. Your dedication has made this initiative thrive, and we are excited to see it grow even further in the years to come.





Here’s to many more years of running, giving, and building lasting connections!
